## Generate a report

You need a CTRF or JUnit report.

This reporter works best with a CTRF as it's packed with modern properties. [CTRF reporters](https://ctrf.io/integrations) are available for most testing frameworks and easy to install.

For more details on using JUnit, see [JUnit integration instructions](docs/integrations.md#junit-to-ctrf-integration)

Only `report-path` is required.

## Pull Requests

You can add a pull request comment by using the `pull-request-report` input:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    pull-request-report: true
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  if: always()
```

This uses the built-in
[pull request comment report](docs/report-showcase.md#pull-request-report).

Additionally, you can add any report to a pull request comment by adding the
`pull-request` input:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    flaky-rate-report: true
    pull-request: true
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  if: always()
```

The `pull-request` input works with all reports, including custom.

requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with pull request write permission.

**Note:** Special considerations apply to pull requests from forks. See [Fork Pull Requests](docs/fork-pull-requests.md) for details.

You can also comment on a specific issue or pull request by using the `issue`
input and providing the issue number ():

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    issue: '123'
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  if: always()
```

Requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with issue or pull request write permission.

### Comment Management Inputs

`update-comment` An existing tagged comment is found, the new report is
appended to it. Otherwise, a new comment is created.

`overwrite-comment` An existing tagged comment is found, that comment's entire
content is replaced with the new report. Otherwise, a new comment is created.

`always-latest-comment` Create a new comment if the existing comment is not the latest in the thread. Use with `update-comment` or `overwrite-comment`. Default is false

`comment-tag` A unique identifier for comments posted. Used to find and
update/overwrite existing comments.

For example, the following command creates or updates a comment tagged with the
current workflow and job names:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    flaky-rate-report: true
    pull-request: true
    update-comment: true
    comment-tag: '${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.job }}'
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  if: always()
```

## Status Checks

The `status-check` input creates a status check for the workflow.

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    status-check: true
    status-check-name: 'GitHub Test Reporter Results'
  if: always()
```

Requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with status check write permission.

## Build Your Own Report

The `custom-report` input lets you build your own report using a Handlebars
template. The template can include any markdown content and leverage data from
your CTRF report and GitHub properties, allowing for dynamic and customizable
report.

Add the following to your workflow file:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    template-path: './templates/custom-report.hbs'
    custom-report: true
  if: always()
```

For detailed instructions on building your own report, see the
[documentation](docs/build-your-own-report.md).

For inspiration, check out the [built-in reports](src/reports) and
[community reports](community-reports)

## Community Reports

We welcome and encourage contributions of community-built reports. Community
reports allow users to share custom reports designed for specific use cases.

To submit a community-built report create a Pull Request.

You can see available [community built reports](community-reports)

Add the following to your workflow file:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    community-report: true
    community-report-name: summary-short
  if: always()
```

## Customizing Report Order

The GitHub Test Reporter allows you to customize the order in which reports appear in your job summary or pull request comments. This feature gives you complete control over how your test results are presented. To customize the order of reports, use the `report-order` parameter with a comma-separated list of report types:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    summary-report: true
    failed-report: true
    flaky-report: true
    insights-report: true
    test-report: true
    # Order reports with the most important information first
    report-order: 'summary-report,failed-report,flaky-report,insights-report,test-report'
  if: always()
```

If report-order is not provided, a default order is used.

## GitHub Token

`previous-results-report`, `insights-report`, `flaky-rate-report`, `fail-rate-report`, and `slowest-report` need a
GITHUB_TOKEN:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    flaky-rate-report: true
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  if: always()
```

## Storing Artifacts

Some reports require you to store CTRF reports as artifacts, use the
`upload-artifact` input for full capabilities:

```yaml
- name: Upload test results
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    upload-artifact: true
  if: always()
```

## Filtering

`previous-results-report`, `flaky-rate-report` and `fail-rate-report` filter
previous results as follows:

- Runs from the same branch for events of type push, schedule and
  workflow_dispatch from the same workflow id
- Runs from the same pull request for events of type pull_request from the same
  workflow id

This ensures that you only see workflow runs that are related to your current
branch or pull request

## Baseline Reports

You can specify a baseline report to use for delta and metrics comparison using the `baseline` or `baseline-report-path` inputs.

- `baseline`: Specify a baseline report by providing either a number (e.g., 1 for the last run, 2 for the run before that) or a string representing the report ID. This allows you to compare your current test results against a specific previous run. The default value is 1, which uses the most recent previous report as the baseline.

- `baseline-report-path`: Provide a path to a specific CTRF report file to use as the baseline for comparison. This is useful if you want to compare against a particular report that is on the filesystem.

## Integrations

CTRF tooling offers seamless developer tool integration, allowing you to combine the GitHub Test Reporter with the following tools:

| Integration | Description | Repository |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Slack Test Reporter | Send test results and notifications to Slack channels | [ctrf-io/slack-test-reporter](https://github.com/ctrf-io/slack-test-reporter) |
| Microsoft Teams Test Reporter | Post test results and alerts to Teams channels | [ctrf-io/teams-test-reporter](https://github.com/ctrf-io/teams-test-reporter) |
| AI Test Reporter | Intelligent test analysis using leading AI models | [ctrf-io/ai-test-reporter](https://github.com/ctrf-io/ai-test-reporter) |

For detailed information about configuring and using these integrations, see our [Integrations Documentation](docs/integrations.md).

Integrations are currently in beta. Please report any issues to the [GitHub Test Reporter repository](https://github.com/ctrf-io/github-test-reporter/issues).

## Generating an AI Report

You can generate human-readable AI report for your failed tests using models
from the leading AI providers by using the AI Test Reporter integration or the 
[AI Test Reporter](https://github.com/ctrf-io/ai-test-reporter) directly. 

## Further Processing

You can further process the CTRF report by using the output `report` from the action or by using the `write-ctrf-to-file` input. For reports larger than 1MB, consider using the `write-ctrf-to-file` input.

This exposes the internal processed CTRF report that is enriched with properties used by the github test reporter.

```yaml
- name: Write CTRF to File
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    write-ctrf-to-file: './ctrf/ctrf-report.json'
  if: always()
```

## What is CTRF?

A test results report schema that provides a standardized format for JSON test
reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often
produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it
easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema
that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically
analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
