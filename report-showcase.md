## Summary Report

### Overview

Provides a quick summary of the test results, displayed in a concise table format. Use it to get an overview of test statuses, including passed, failed, skipped, pending, flaky and other categories.

### Usage

Set the `summary-report` input to true in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    summary-report: true
  if: always()
```

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 11.0s |


## Test Report

### Overview

Provides a detailed test report of all executed test cases, including their status, whether they are marked as flaky, and their execution duration. Use this table to identify test cases that passed, failed, are skipped, pending, or marked with other statuses. It also highlights tests that require attention due to potential flakiness.

### Usage

Set the `test-report` input to true in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    test-report: true
  if: always()
```

| **Test Name** | **Status** | **Flaky** | **Duration** |

| should be able to login | ✅ |  | 1.2s |
| should display title | ❌ |  | 800ms |
| should be able to update profile | ✅ | 🍂 | 1.2s |
| should be able to logout | ⏭️ |  | 1ms |
| should validate user settings | ✅ |  | 1.1s |
| should fail to update profile on network failure | ❌ |  | 900ms |
| should fail to update profile on network failure | ❌ |  | 900ms |
| should load user data | ⏳ |  | 1ms |
| should handle session timeouts | ✅ | 🍂 | 950ms |
| should clean up user session on logout | ❓ |  | 1.1s |
| should allow user to change password | ✅ | 🍂 | 1.3s |


## Test List Report

### Overview

Provides a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of all executed test cases, their statuses, and associated error messages or additional context for failures. This report is particularly useful for quickly identifying failed tests, understanding why they failed, and tracking the overall progress of test execution. Each test case includes its status (e.g., passed, failed, skipped, etc.) along with any relevant failure details

### Usage

Set the `test-list-report` input to true in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    test-list-report: true
  if: always()
```

## Failed Report

### Overview

Focuses exclusively on failed test cases, providing a clear and concise summary of each failure. For every failed test, the report includes the test name, the failure message. This report is designed to help developers quickly diagnose and address issues.

### Usage

Set the `failed-report` input to true in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    failed-report: true
  if: always()
```

## Fail Rate Report

### Overview

Provides a detailed analysis of the fail rates for tests that are currently live and were executed in the latest run. By incorporating both the current run and historical data, it provides a comprehensive view of test stability over time. This report highlights the fail rate for each individual test as well as the overall fail rate for the entire test execution, helping teams evaluate the reliability of their test suite and focus on areas that require attention.

The fail rate reflects how often tests fail based on their final outcomes, excluding any retries. This metric identifies tests with consistent failures, enabling teams to prioritize fixes and improve overall test reliability.

Test case fail rate is calculated by dividing the fail count by the total runs
and multiplying by 100:

Fail Rate (%) = (Fail Count ÷ Total Runs) × 100

Overall fail rate across all tests is calculated by summing the fail counts and
total runs of all tests:

Overall Fail Rate (%) = (Total Fail Counts of All Tests ÷ Total Runs of All
Tests) × 100

### Usage

Set the `fail-rate-report` input to true in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Report
  uses: ctrf-io/github-test-reporter@v1
  with:
    report-path: './ctrf/*.json'
    fail-rate-report: true
  if: always()
```
