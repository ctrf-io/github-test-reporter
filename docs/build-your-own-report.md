# Build Your Own Report

Creating a Handlebars markdown template allows you to have full control over how
your test results are displayed. With CTRF, GitHub and Handlebars you can inject
dynamic content into your reports, making your them flexible to suit your needs.

You can apply custom templates when using the `custom-report` method.

## Showcase

All of our reports are built using handlebars, for inspiration check out the
[built-in reports](src/reports) and [community reports](community-reports).

For more ideas, see the [custom report example](templates/custom-report.hbs).

## Handlebars

Handlebars is a simple templating language that lets you insert data into your
markdown in a declarative way. You can use placeholders, conditionals, and loops
to dynamically generate content based on your test results.

## Basic Example

Here's a basic example of a Handlebars template that you might use to generate a
custom summary.

```hbs
# Custom Test Summary **Total Tests**:
{{ctrf.summary.tests}}
**Passed**:
{{ctrf.summary.passed}}
**Failed**:
{{ctrf.summary.failed}}
**Flaky Tests**:
{{countFlaky ctrf.tests}}
**Duration**:
{{formatDuration ctrf.summary.start ctrf.results.summary.stop}}
```

## CTRF properties

CTRF properties are made available to use in your template. You can access these
properties `ctrf` property, for example `ctrf.summary.passed`

## GitHub Properties

GitHub properties are made available to use in your template. You can access
these properties `github` property, for example `github.repoName`

You can access the entire context via the `github.context` property.

[Contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs)
are a way to access information about workflow runs, variables, runner
environments, jobs, and steps. Each context is an object that contains
properties, which can be strings or other objects.

Contexts, objects, and properties will vary significantly under different
workflow run conditions. For example, the matrix context is only populated for
jobs in a matrix.

You can see the content of the context by printing it in the logs:

```yaml
- name: Print GitHub Context
  env:
    CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
  run: echo "$CONTEXT" | jq .
```

In addition to context, common properties are made available.

## Helpers

When writing your template, you can use several Handlebars helpers:

- `{{countFlaky ctrf.tests}}`: Counts and returns the number of flaky tests.

- `{{formatDuration ctrf.summary.start ctrf.summary.stop}}`: Formats the
  duration between start and stop times into a human-readable string.

- `{{stripAnsi message}}`: Strips ANSI from string, useful for when error
  messages contain ANSI characters.

- `{{eq arg1 arg2}}`: Compares two arguments and returns true if they are equal.

See available helpers [here](src/handlebars/helpers).

We welcome contributions for additional helpers.
