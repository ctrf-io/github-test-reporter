      "ai": "The test suite experienced failures due to issues related to timing and network configuration. The first test failed because the expected page title did not match the actual title within the specified timeout, suggesting a potential mismatch in the expected title pattern or insufficient timeout duration. The second test encountered a real network timeout instead of the simulated failure it was designed to test, indicating problems with the network setup or timeout settings in the test environment. These failures point to a need for reviewing and adjusting both the expected outcomes and the test environment configurations to better align with actual application behavior and network conditions."
