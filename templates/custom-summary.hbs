# Create a Custom Summary!

You can effortlessly generate custom test summaries and PR comments using your CTRF report, Handlebars and Markdown. 

## Example: Generating a Summary

Let's start with the basics, a summary table that gives an overview of your test ctrf (you might have seen this one somewhere!). This table is straightforward yet powerful, helping you quickly communicate the state of your tests:

| **Tests 📝** | **Passed ✅** | **Failed ❌** | **Skipped ⏭️** | **Pending ⏳** | **Other ❓** | **Flaky 🍂** | **Duration ⏱️** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {{data.results.summary.tests}} | {{data.results.summary.passed}} | {{data.results.summary.failed}} | {{data.results.summary.skipped}} | {{data.results.summary.pending}} | {{data.results.summary.other}} | {{data.results.summary.pending}} | {{ data.results.summary.pending}} |

This table is generated by referencing various properties from your CTRF report, making it easy to create detailed and customized summaries.
